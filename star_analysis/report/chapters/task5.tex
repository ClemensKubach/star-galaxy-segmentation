For easy installation we provide a requirements file for conda. It can be installed by calling
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
conda install --file requirements.txt 
\end{lstlisting}
Then one needs to add the root of our repository to the $PYTHONPATH$. This can be eather done by navigating into the root prior to calling python or by
\begin{lstlisting}
export PYTHONPATH=\$PYTHONPATH:<path>
\end{lstlisting}
The entrypoint to our system is \path{run_script.py} for the deep learning models and \path{run_classical_ai.py} for the classical ones.
