For easy installation we provide a requirements file for conda. It can be installed by calling
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
    $ conda install --file requirements.txt 
\end{lstlisting}
Then one needs to add the root of our repository to the $PYTHONPATH$. This can be eather done by navigating into the root prior to calling python or by $export PYTHONPATH=\$PYTHONPATH:<path>$
The entrypoint to our system is \path{run_script.py}. Just calling it will reproduce our deep neural network experiments.
