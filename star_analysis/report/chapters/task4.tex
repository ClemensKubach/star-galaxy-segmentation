We tryied the following augmentation methods: random flip (horizontal, vertical and both), rotation up to 30 degrees, both combined and balancing the classes per slice by artificially sampling new stars or galaxies respectively.
The implementation of the augmentations can be seen in \path{star_analysis/data/augmentations.py}.
